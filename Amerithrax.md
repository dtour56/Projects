# 2001 US anthrax attacks
## Background
Following the 9/11 attacks

Five letters containing B. *anthracis* (anthrax)

The two letters sent to New York, each going to Tom Brokaw and NYPost was instead a mixture of that same anthrax along with a genetically distinct variant of B. *subtilis*, a lower grade contaminant.<sup>[1](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13098/chapter/7#104)</sup>

### Suspects
al-Qaeda
Iraq
Steven Hatfill
Bruce Ivins, a bacteriologist who worked with anthrax at Fort Detrick, MA on behalf of USAMRIID 

### Forensics
Through phenotypic testing, microbiologists contracted by the FBI discovered:

- The strain of Anthrax used in the attacks was the Ames strain, which in the US was only held by 16 laboratories, including USAMRIID's Fort Detrick.<sup>[1](https://vault.fbi.gov/Amerithrax/Amerithrax%20Part%2020%20of%2059#page=16)</sup>

- The only match to all four genotypes found during the investigation was sample RMR-1029 taken from a flask which was under the exclusive custody of Bruce Ivins, which the FBI would conclude was the origin point for the anthrax used in the attacks.<sup>[2](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/amx-investigative-summary.pdf#page=32)</sup>

- None of the B. *subtilis* strains that Ivins had in stock at Detrick did not match the B. *subtilis* contaminant from the mixture in the Post and Brokaw envelopes. There was also no trace of it in the RMR-1029 sample.<sup>[3](https://vault.fbi.gov/Amerithrax/Amerithrax%20Part%2020%20of%2059#page=16)</sup>

To corroborate their findings, the FBI requested the research council of the National Academy of Sciences to examine the forensic practices of those involved in identifying RMR-1029 as the source.<sup>[4](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13098/chapter/3#26)</sup> The NRC's [review](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13098/chapter/1) concluded that there was insufficient evidence to reach a definitive conclusion on the origin of the anthrax spores contained in the letters.<sup>[5](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13098/chapter/8#144)</sup> 

The Government Accountability Office was also asked to conduct an [ independent study](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-15-80.pdf) into the FBI's genetic testing procedures and statistical analyses, the results of which were consistent with the examination by the NAS. The GAO specifically fixated on the lack of a comprehensive framework in the FBI's investigation and offered suggestions for how they could improve it.<sup>[6](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-15-80.pdf#page=57)</sup> <sup>[7](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-15-80)</sup>



Detrick microbiologist Henry Heine stated that the specific strain from the letters would have taken 30-50 weeks of continuous labor to produce assuming that Ivins was the only one involved in brewing the spores.<sup>[8](https://www.propublica.org/article/new-evidence-disputes-case-against-bruce-e-ivins)</sup> Given that time frame and the assumption that it was brewed at Detrick in flask RMR-1029, detectable contamination on equipment frequently used by Ivins should have been present.


### Statements
During a hearing, Patrick Leahy, one of the two senators targeted by the mailings cast doubt on the FBI's conclusions. He stated: "I do not believe in any way, shape or manner that he (Ivins) is the only person involved in this attack on Congress and the American people. I do not believe that at all."<sup>[1](https://books.google.com/books?id=E75E9BADGukC&pg=PA16)</sup> <sup>[2](https://www.c-span.org/video/?281169-1/federal-bureau-investigation-oversight)</sup>

2001 US anthrax attacks
Background

Following the 9/11 attacks

Five letters containing B. anthracis (anthrax)

The two letters sent to New York, each going to Tom Brokaw and NYPost was instead a mixture of that same anthrax along with a genetically distinct variant of B. subtilis, a lower grade contaminant.1

Forensics

Through phenotypic testing, microbiologists contracted by the FBI discovered:

    The strain of Anthrax used in the attacks was the Ames strain, which in the US was only held by 16 laboratories, including USAMRIID’s Fort Detrick.1

    The only match to all four genotypes found during the investigation was sample RMR-1029 taken from a flask which was under the exclusive custody of Bruce Ivins, which the FBI would conclude was the origin point for the anthrax used in the attacks.2

    None of the B. subtilis strains that Ivins had in stock at Detrick did not match the B. subtilis contaminant from the mixture in the Post and Brokaw envelopes. There was also no trace of it in the RMR-1029 sample.3

To corroborate their findings, the FBI requested the research council of the National Academy of Sciences to examine the forensic practices of those involved in identifying RMR-1029 as the source.4 The NRC’s review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to reach a definitive conclusion on the origin of the anthrax spores contained in the letters.5

The Government Accountability Office was also asked to conduct an independent study into the FBI’s genetic testing procedures and statistical analyses, the results of which were consistent with the examination by the NAS. The GAO specifically fixated on the lack of a comprehensive framework in the FBI’s investigation and offered suggestions for how they could improve it.6 7

Detrick microbiologist Henry Heine stated that the specific strain from the letters would have taken 30-50 weeks of continuous labor to produce assuming that Ivins was the only one involved in brewing the spores.8 Given that time frame and the assumption that it was brewed at Detrick in flask RMR-1029, detectable contamination on equipment frequently used by Ivins should have been present.
