I specifically left out many diagnoses of anthrax that are irrelevant due to being easily explainable or just uninteresting in general. See the [**FAS timeline**](https://irp.fas.org/threat/cbw/anthrax.pdf#page=17) and [**this other FAS timeline**](https://books.google.com/books?id=2ChqGIvW-rsC&pg=PA425 "NOTE: I could not find the original source mentioned on the page, I looked fuckin everywhere for it") for a more detailed list.

## Mailings
Following the 9/11 attacks, Five letters containing B. *anthracis* (anthrax) were sent to journalists and congressmen. The first letter

A pair of envelopes <sup>[**A**](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/d-post-brokaw-envelopes.pdf)</sup> were addressed to NBC journalist Tom Brokaw <sup>[**B**](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/a-brokaw-letter.pdf "Brokaw letter")</sup> and New York Post.<sup>[**C**](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/a-post-letter.pdf "NY Post letter")</sup> The powder within these letters was instead a mixture of two , the anthrax from the AMI letter along with a genetically distinct variant of B. *subtilis*, a lower grade contaminant.<sup>[**1**](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13098/chapter/7#104)</sup>

The final pair of envelopes <sup>[**D**](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/c-daschle-leahy-envelopes.pdf)</sup> were addressed to senators Patrick Leahy <sup>[**E**](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/b-leahy-letter.pdf "Leahy letter")</sup> and Tom Daschle.<sup>[**F**](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/b-daschle-letter.pdf "Daschle letter")</sup> The message was slightly different from the Post and Brokaw letters.

All five letters originated from and the Nassau Street box in Trenton, NJ 

> The handwriting differs somewhat between the letters, such as the R's and the size of the words. The most widely circulated theory is that the culprit coerced a child to write the notes for him; although there is no hard evidence to support this claim. It primarily relies on the assumption that adults who disguise their handwriting generally do not have as many inconsistencies as were present in the Anthrax letters. Of course, it's possible that the variance was an intentional obfuscation.
### Hoax letters
An often overlooked aspect of the anthrax attacks are the hoax letters that fell completely in alignment with the rest of the mailings. The handwriting techniques were [remarkably similar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GxVrfEJG5cmU1s3i-TifxIc2U4_oTpAF/view "Credit: Robbie Martin & Gumby4christ"),

### Suspects
al-Qaeda </br>
Iraq </br>
Ayaad Assaad, a former Detrick Microbiologist who was relentlessly harassed by his coworkers to the point of leaving in December 1991 as well as suing the army. He was also the subject of an anonymous document received by Quantico Marine Base. Whoever sent this document would have had an incredible foreknowledge of the actual anthrax attacks that would follow. The FBI declared the document a hoax following an interview with Assaad.
One of the Detrick employees involved in harassing Assaad was Philip Zack, who was caught several times doing unauthorized lab work that allegedly involved anthrax. </br>
Steven Hatfill </br>
Syed Athar Abbas </br>
Bruce Ivins, a bacteriologist who worked with anthrax at Fort Detrick, MA on behalf of USAMRIID

### Forensics
Through phenotypic testing, microbiologists contracted by the FBI discovered:

- The strain of Anthrax used in the attacks was the Ames strain, which in the US was only held by 16 laboratories, including USAMRIID's Fort Detrick.<sup>[**1**](https://vault.fbi.gov/Amerithrax/Amerithrax%20Part%2020%20of%2059#page=16)</sup>

- The only match to all four genotypes found during the investigation was sample RMR-1029 taken from a flask which was under the exclusive custody of Bruce Ivins, of which was widely considered as the origin point for the anthrax used in the attacks.<sup>[**2**](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/amx-investigative-summary.pdf#page=32)</sup>

- None of the B. *subtilis* strains that Ivins had in stock at Detrick matched the B. *subtilis* contaminant from the mixture in the Post and Brokaw envelopes. There was also no trace of it in the RMR-1029 sample.<sup>[**3**](https://vault.fbi.gov/Amerithrax/Amerithrax%20Part%2020%20of%2059#page=16)</sup>

To corroborate their findings, the FBI requested the research council of the National Academy of Sciences to examine the forensic practices of those involved in identifying RMR-1029 as the source.<sup>[**4**](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13098/chapter/3#26)</sup> The NRC's [review](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13098/chapter/1) concluded that there was insufficient evidence to reach a definitive conclusion on the origin of the anthrax spores contained in the letters.<sup>[**5**](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13098/chapter/8#144)</sup> 

The Government Accountability Office was also asked to conduct an [ independent study](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-15-80.pdf) into the FBI's genetic testing procedures and statistical analyses, the results of which were consistent with the examination by the NAS. The GAO specifically fixated on the lack of a comprehensive framework in the FBI's investigation and offered suggestions for how they could improve it.<sup>[**6**](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-15-80.pdf#page=57)</sup> <sup>[**7**](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-15-80)</sup>



Detrick microbiologist Henry Heine stated that the specific strain from the letters would have taken 30-50 weeks of continuous labor to produce assuming that Ivins was the only one involved in brewing the spores.<sup>[**8**](https://www.propublica.org/article/new-evidence-disputes-case-against-bruce-e-ivins)</sup> Given that time frame and the assumption that it was brewed at Detrick in flask RMR-1029, detectable contamination on equipment frequently used by Ivins should have been present.


### Statements
During a hearing, Patrick Leahy, one of the two senators targeted by the mailings cast doubt on the FBI's conclusions. He stated: "I do not believe in any way, shape or manner that he (Ivins) is the only person involved in this attack on Congress and the American people. I do not believe that at all."<sup>[**1**](https://books.google.com/books?id=E75E9BADGukC&pg=PA16)</sup> <sup>[**2**](https://www.c-span.org/video/?281169-1/federal-bureau-investigation-oversight)</sup>
